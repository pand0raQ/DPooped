I am creating ios app for dog owners, to inform each other, did the dog pooped in last walk or not let me describe the app that we gonna build 1. when the app launched, there is profile tab. in profile , you can create profile using apple id 2. after logging in, the dog owner register their dog info - ( name, picture) 3. after that, owner can add other users to co parent dog(optional). we gonna use SwiftData + CloudKit real time database for our project. 4. dog owner or co-parent gonna have ability to add widget to their home screen. that widget gonna live sync and be interactable. 5.widget gonna contain dog name and picture , information when date + time the last walk happened, did he pooped on last walk or not. in the same widget , gonna be buttons to log walk , log walk+ relief ( pooped or not) , and a small button "request walk" from other parent. The whole idea is for dog owners to be informed about their dog last walk. when it happend, did he pooped or not (we are solving a problem with constant communication of parents to each other before walks) . Also we giving to them button to request walk ( in a case that one of them forget to walk a dog )
